# Pipeline monitoring and reporting 

!!! info "Learning objectives"

    - Inspect workflow performance and resource usage utilising Nextflow's
    in-built monitoring features
    - Compare the trade-offs between Nextflow's profiling features in comparison to unix tools such as `time` or `gprof`

Once we get the workflow running without error on the scheduler, where can we optimise. 

Look at the report.html. Create a more informative trace file: https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reports.html#trace-file
