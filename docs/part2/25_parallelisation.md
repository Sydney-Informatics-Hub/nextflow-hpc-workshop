# Parallelisation

!!! info "Learning objectives"

    - Consider the limitations of parallelisation and scenarios where it should
    not be applied
    - Differentiate between multithreading and scatter-gather approaches to
    parallelisation
    - Implement parallelisation approaches (multithreading, multiprocessing)
    while preserving biological correctness


## Multithreading 

## Multi-processing with scatter-gather

## Bonus: Dynamic resourcing
