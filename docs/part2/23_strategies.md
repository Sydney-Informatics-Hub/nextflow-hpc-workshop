# Overcoming performance bottlenecks with HPC optimisation strategies

!!! info "Learning objectives"

    - Understand how HPC resource requests affect job scheduling and performance
    - Identify process and configuration bottlenecks in trace reports
    
## Overview on optimisation strategies

Recap on Part 1.4 Work smarter, not harder

Key strategies:

1. Right sizing: match resources to what the process actually uses (CPU, memory, time)
2. Multithreading
3. Multi-processing

## Identifying process and configuration bottlenecks

!!! example "Exercise"

    TODO Review trace files, identify processes that are hitting close to 100% CPU/memory usage.

    TODO Any tools that support multithreading? Is it always good to apply?

    TODO Review workflow structure - can anything be broken down and run in parallel?
