# Scale to multiple samples

!!! info "Learning objectives"

    - Apply an optimised pipeline across multiple samples
    - Understand and compare sample-level and within-sample parallelism
    - Recall best practices for running multi-sample data with samplesheets
    
Now it has run successfully and efficiently on one, run on multiple samples in parallel. Explain sample-level paralellism. Refer back to smarter not harder lesson in HPC foundations. 

!!! example "Exercise"

    Run pipeline with `samplesheets_full.csv`
