## Installing Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a versatile code editor that we will use for the
workshop. We will use VSCode to connect to the VM, navigate the directories,
edit, view and download files.

1. Download VSCode by following the [installation instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) for your local Operating System.
2. Open VSCode to confirm it was installed correctly.

## Installing the VSCode extensions

Specific VSCode extensions are required to connect to the VM and make working with Nextflow files easier (i.e. syntax highlighting).

1. In the VSCode sidebar on the left, click on the extensions button (four blocks)
2. In the Extensions Marketplace search bar, search for `remote ssh`. Select **"Remote - SSH"**
