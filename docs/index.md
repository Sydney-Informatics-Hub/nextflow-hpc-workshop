# Nextflow and HPC

This workshop is delivered over 2 3-hour sessions that cover how HPC works, to running and optimising workflows on it using Nextflow and nf-core.

We work through a realistic experimental scenario: adapting a whole genome variant calling workflow to run on high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Each lesson connects foundational HPC concepts to workflow design and configuration in Nextflow.

This workshop is delivered concurrently on Australia's Tier-1 HPCs; [NCI's Gadi HPC](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems) and [Pawsey's Setonix HPC](https://pawsey.org.au/systems/setonix/).

## Prerequisites

This is an intermediate-advanced workshop for people developing reproducible bioinformatics workflows to run on HPC. It assumes experience with the following:

- Running and developing Nextflow workflows
- Working in a Linux environment using basic scripting (e.g. Bash)
- Working on a HPC cluster.

Attendees would benefit from having previously completed our [Nextflow for the Life Sciences workshop](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/hello-nextflow-2025/).

## Set up requirements

Please see our [set up instructions](./setup.md) to set up your laptop for this workshop.

## Code of Conduct

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours at all our events and on our platforms:
