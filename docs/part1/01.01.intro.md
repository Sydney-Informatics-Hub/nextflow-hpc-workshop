!!! example "Exercise 1.1.3: Getting started on HPC"

    Log in to your assigned HPC with the user account and password provided to you.

    === "Gadi"

        ```bash
        ssh username@gadi.nci.org.au
        ```

    === "Setonix"

        ```bash
        ssh username@setonix.pawsey.org.au
        ```

    For this workshop, we will be working within the scratch storage system of the HPCs. Navigate to the scratch space for the workshop project. The project ID will be provided to you on the day of the workshop.

    === "Gadi"

        NCI projects have randomly-assigned IDs with a two letter and two digit pattern, e.g. `ab01`. The scratch space for the project can be found at `/scratch/<PROJECT_ID>`:

        ```bash
        cd /scratch/ab01
        ```

    === "Setonix"

        Pawsey projects have IDs of the form `pawsey1234`. The scratch space for the project can be found at `/scratch/<PROJECT_ID>`:

        ```bash
        cd /scratch/pawsey1234
        ```

    Within the scratch space, you will find a folder with your user name. Navigate into this folder:

    === "Gadi"

        ```bash
        cd /scratch/ab01/username
        ```

    === "Setonix"

        ```bash
        cd /scratch/pawsey1234/username
        ```

    In here, you will find several folders containing pre-loaded materials for this workshop:

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

    ```console title="Output"
    01.hpc_fundamentals
    02.nf-core
    03.diy_workflow
    ```

    For this section, we will be working in `01.hpc_fundamentals/`. Navigate to this directory and inspect its contents; you will find some pre-loaded scripts and data for this section:

    ```bash
    cd 01.hpc_fundamentals
    ls
    ```

    ```console title="Output"
    data/
    ref/
    fastqc.sh
    ```
