# 1.4 HPC architecture for workflows 

While HPCs can look intimidating, their architecture follows a simple structure that supports large-scale computation through shared resources. From a workflow perspective, this architecture means there are a few important realities to accept: work is not run interactively, resources must be requested rather than assumed and everything is governed by shared access.

## Login nodes 
When a user connects to an HPC, they first land on a login node. This is a shared access point used to prepare work, not perform computations. From here, users submit jobs to the scheduler, monitor their progress and organise their project directories. The login node exists only to coordinate access to the system, and because it is shared by many people at once, it must not be overloaded with computational tasks.

## Compute nodes
The real work happens on the compute nodes. These are powerful machines with many CPU cores, large amounts of memory and fast access to storage. Workflows do not run directly on them; instead, the scheduler assigns workflow tasks to available compute nodes based on the resources requested. This separation between the login node and compute nodes allows users to interact with the system while computation is queued and executed elsewhere.

## Shared storage
All nodes are connected to a shared parallel filesystem. This is a large, high-speed storage system where input data, reference files and workflow outputs are kept. Because it is shared across all users, it enables collaborative research and scalable workflows. However, it also introduces constraints around file organisation and performance, which is why workflows must be careful about how they read and write data here.

## Job scheduler
At the centre of everything is the job scheduler. Rather than allowing users to run programs directly, HPCs rely on a scheduling system (e.g. Slurm or PBS Pro) to manage fair access to shared compute resources. When a job is submitted, it enters a queue where the scheduler decides when and where it will run. Jobs are matched to compute nodes based on requested resources like CPU, memory and runtime. Understanding how the scheduler behaves is essential for designing workflows that run efficiently.
